# Antlers Toolbox

This Visual Studio Code extension provides rich language support for the Antlers templating language, used for building Statamic websites.

This extension provides the following awesome capabilities:

* Basic syntax highlighting, *and* parser-driving semantic highlighting
* Modifier signature suggestions
* Intelligent suggestions based on your unique project's blueprints, collections, and more!
* Antlers formatting
* Support for core Statamic 3 tags, modifiers, and more!

## Installation

To install the extension on your local machine, simply open Visual Studio Code and search for "Antlers Language for Statamic" in the Extensions panel. Once you find it, click "Install".

The extension will automatically activate the next time you open an Antlers HTML file.

Want to take your install even further? Consider checking out the documentation at [https://antlers.dev/](https://antlers.dev/).

## Reloading Project Details

If you have made significant changes to your project's blueprints, globals, etc. and have Visual Studio Code open to just the `resources/` directory, you may want to force the extension to reload your project's details. This can be done from Visual Studio Code's [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and searching for "Antlers: Reload Statamic Project Details".
