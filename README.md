# An Antlers Extension for Visual Studio Code

This Visual Studio Code extension provides rich language support for the Antlers templating language, used for building Statamic websites.

This extension provides the following awesome capabilities:

* Basic syntax highlighting, *and* parser-driving semantic highlighting
* Modifier signature suggestions
* Intelligent suggestions based on your unique project's blueprints, collections, and more!
* An extensive add-on system
* Support for core Statamic 3 tags, modifiers, and more!

## Installation

To install the extension on your local machine, simply open Visual Studio Code and search for "Antlers Language for Statamic" in the Extensions panel. Once you find it, click "Install".

The extension will automatically activate the next time you open an Antlers HTML file.

Want to take your install even further? Consider checking out the documentation at [https://antlers.dev/](https://antlers.dev/).

## System PHP Configuration

If your development machine has PHP7+ installed and available in the `PATH` system variable, the extension will utilize a built-in PHP analyzer to help find details about your custom tags, view models, augmentation and Composer dependencies.

Having this enabled is not a requirement to use the extension's main features.
